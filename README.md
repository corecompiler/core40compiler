The "core 4.0 'multi technology' compiler 'all purpose'" is a new, open-source compiler framework that allows for the creation of new programming languages and supports multiple output technologies. It is not a traditional compiler for a single, predefined language, but a meta-compiler designed for flexibility and language creation. 
Key features and concepts of Core 4.0 include:
Open to new languages: Core 4.0's design is focused on being a platform for defining and building new languages. This differs from most compilers that are built to translate one specific language, like the Java compiler or the GCC C compiler.
"All-Purpose": The "all purpose" characteristic refers to the potential of languages defined within Core 4.0 to perform any task. This is achieved by allowing the use of well-known programming languages within its framework, making it suitable for a wide array of application domains.
"Multi-Technology": The "multi technology" feature means that the target language (the output of the compilation) can be any—and more than one—of today's programming languages or technologies. This capability allows developers to translate a single source language into multiple outputs, potentially targeting different platforms or environments.
Suitable for special processors: Because it can translate high-level languages into low-level ones like assembly, Core 4.0 is also specifically designed to act as a compiler for specialized processors.
